                        Nine Arches Bridge, also known as Ahas Namaye Palama or The Bridge in the Sky, is an iconic
                        architectural structure located in the mountainous region of Ella in Sri Lanka. It is a
                        magnificent stone bridge, built amidst lush green tea plantations, with stunning mountains in
                        the backdrop. This ancient construction is 91 metres long and 24 metres high and never fails to
                        leave tourists spellbound at its beauty.

                        An interesting story revolves around the construction of this bridge. Soon after this bridge was
                        constructed by the British, the first world war broke out. Thus, the steel used in the
                        development of the bridge was used in the weapons for the war. But, a Sri Lankan named Appuhami
                        took it upon himself to complete the construction. This builder meticulously worked on the
                        development, with the available material and finances, and before the deadline. The bridge was
                        built of stone and cement and has stood tall till date, which is an architectural wonder.
                        Photographers from all over the world consider the Nine Arches Bridge the perfect spot for
                        photography.

                        The nine arches bridge can be accessed from the Ella station and is a short trek along the
                        railway tracks to the bridge. Make sure to take note the train timings (mentioned below) to
                        experience the bridge during that time.

                        Just 2 km from Ella city, perched at an altitude of 82 feet is the Ravana cave, and Ravana
                        falls. The history of Sri Lanka dates back to over 2000 years and it finds itself in the iconic
                        Ramayana. It is believed that Ravana was a fervent Sri Lankan by origin and stood as a villain
                        in the lives of duo Ram – Sita. He captured Sita and kept her hostage in his custody in the
                        famous, Ravana caves and the Ravana falls. Landscapes around the Ravana falls comprises of
                        slopes, valleys, hills and streams that ornament the rocks.

                        Historic connotations of this marvel date back as old as 25,000 years. The falls are beautiful;
                        there is vegetation in the form of greenery, tall deciduous trees and twigs sprouting from the
                        crevices of the rock. The walls of the falls are coarse but relaxed at the same time to give the
                        feeling of a polished sun-kissed stone. The water pours down at high velocity and makes a sweet
                        thud as it hits the pools of water. The breeze is another factor that adds to its beauty. In the
                        evenings the breeze is at full swing, that the roar of the wind competes with the sound of the
                        gushing waters. You can soak yourself in the waters that held Sita as she bathed in them during
                        her time in Lanka. The cave is known for one of the widest waterfalls in Sri Lanka and is
                        bounded by a thick blanket of forests and are perfect for a swim.

                        Little Adam's peak is the mini version of the pilgrimage mountain site of central Sri Lanka
                        called Adam's peak. Located in Ella, The little Adam's shape is the same as it's so-called
                        bigger brother The Adam's Peak. It provides a less exhausting and more pleasant alternative as a
                        hiking spot to those who cannot hike on a mountain as big as Adam's peak but also want to see a
                        breathtaking view from a mountain's top.

                        The altitude of Little Adam's peak is 1141 meters, and the total time one will require for the
                        hike and sightseeing will be a maximum of 3 hours. On the way up there, one can see some lush
                        green tea plantations with smiling tea leaf pickers, colourful birds, flowers and the flying
                        eagles and enjoy the emanation of pleasant smell from the tea plantation. One is highly advised
                        to visit Little Adam's peak either before sunrise or before sunset as the sun presents itself
                        most engagingly during these times of the day.

                        The Ravana caves are located 2 km away from the Ella town on the foundation of a cliff and are
                        said to be about 4000 years old. One can take a car up on the hill till one reaches the Ravana
                        Ella temple (which is 2500 years old), and from there it is a trek of 800 steps till the Ravana
                        caves. In between, one can find a small tea stall where you can enjoy some refreshing tea amidst
                        the pleasant breeze of the hill or take some rest there. There are some cemented steps and some
                        made of rocks and tree roots, and one can see many monkeys on the way and hear birds chirping.

                        The path appears quite intriguing and mysterious with dense forest and tree roots covering
                        everywhere. As one gets close to the caves, a panoramic view of the mountains reveals itself.
                        Once one reaches the mouth of the cave one steps into a broad area which is considered a part of
                        Ravana’s palace and walking into the farthest point of the cave is both exciting and terrifying
                        as it is pitch black inside. Thus it is suggested to carry a torchlight.

                        It is believed that the demon king Ravana built an underground palace and the path to that
                        palace started from these caves. It is a place for travel enthusiasts and explorers who like to
                        take the road less travelled and are always looking for challenging paths.

                        The Dhowa temple is located in the beautiful Uva province and is a popular tourist attraction.
                        The Dhova rock temple is almost 2000 years old and was used as a sanctuary for King Walagamba.
                        The king later converted the cave into a temple.

                        The Dhowa rock temple is famous for its rock paintings and sculptures which are on the walls of
                        the cave. It is said that King Walagamba himself had a great passion for art and has done most
                        of the rock paintings himself. The Dhowa rock temple opens with a beautiful gateway which greets
                        the devotees and the tourists. Another striking feature of the temple is the stunning 38 feet
                        tall Buddha sculpture on the rock, which is an excellent example of the Mahayana style of
                        Buddhist statues.

                        The Demodara Loop is a spiral railway loop in Demodara and is a piece of cutting-edge civil
                        engineering. The railway line runs underneath itself, snakes around the mountain and appears
                        from a tunnel which is below the Demodara Railway Station; this railway line is said to be the
                        only one of its kind in the world.

                        In the 20th century, the steep hills of Demodara proved to be difficult for building the current
                        rail line; consequently, a spiral loop, around 441 feet long, was constructed. The engineering
                        aside, Demodara Loop and its verdant surroundings are indeed a sight to behold; experience the
                        charm of the area by taking a train ride, preferably from Ella to Demodara.

                        Muthiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya or Muthiyangana Temple is a Buddhist temple at the centre of
                        Badulla, a town 22.7 km away from Ella. The stupa has a history dating back to the 5th century
                        BC and has continued to be a popular attraction in the country for tourists and pilgrims alike.

                        Muthiyangana Temple is one amongst the sixteen sacred Buddhist temples in the country. According
                        to legends, during Lord Buddha’s third visit to Sri Lanka, he had given his sermons at the
                        location where Muthiyangana Temple now stands. The stupa was built by a tribal leader and later
                        transformed into a temple complex by Sinhalese kings. Apart from the stupa, Muthiyangana Raja
                        Maha Viharaya is also known for the four Bodhi trees at its premises, each tree with an
                        interesting story associated with it. Also, a procession occurs annually at the temple.

                        Duwili Ella Falls or Walawe Ganga East Falls is a milky flow of water that is suspended from a
                        height of 40 metres. Nestled in Thanjantenna village, of Rathnapura district Duwili in Sinhalese
                        translates to ‘dust’. The velocity at which the water pours makes the flow of water look like
                        dust falling from the sky. Hence the name “Duwili”.

                        Thanjantenna is an archaeological village that is deep-rooted in history dating back to many
                        centuries. Its historical significance adds to the cultural importance that the Duwili falls
                        holds. The local community around the falls play a great role in adding to its warm and friendly
                        ambience. The falls is enclosed by a shrubs and shielded with a pack of trees, that reflect the
                        rich vegetation of these lands. The cold waters befit tourists to take a swim in the gushing
                        pours. The rocks lined along serve as a protection for the swimmers and provides a stronghold
                        for the novice to stay afloat as well.

                        The birds, animals and insects in the thick forests that surround Duwili play a pivotal role in
                        the ecosystem. Their constant chants and noises make Duwili a perfect exposure of the woods. The
                        environment is tranquil and provides moments of absolute privacy with nature, as Duwili falls is
                        positioned in such a way! Sunlight shines in the morning leaving a golden hue on the waters and
                        the beam trickles during the early evening. The nights are colder and is perfect to set up camp
                        around a bonfire overlooking the falls and its rich pools of water.

                        Bopath falls is located in Rathnapura district of Sri Lanka. The district by itself stands at an
                        elevation of 130m. Water gushes forth from a mountain cliff, whose crevices appear so minute, it
                        makes one wonder how the water flows at that velocity.

                        Yet again nature surprises us and gives birth to the marvel that is the Bopath falls. The Bopath
                        falls in Rathnapura is an absolute treat to the eyes. The falls derives its name from the fig
                        tree or the sacred “bo tree”. The falls are shaped like the leaves of the Bo tree and hence the
                        title. The Bo tree since early ages was a sign of wisdom, counsel, knowledge understanding and
                        enlightenment; a visit to the Bopath is nothing short of this experience.

                        The waters fall steeply at certain cuts and gradients, and then flows back again. The serenity
                        of the falls is topped with the winds that strike at early dawn and the evenings. Water splashes
                        out of the pool and onto the rocks, if you’re there it will shower you too. Bliss is guaranteed
                        in Bopath! Legend has it that the Bopath falls hides a treasure trove which intensifies the
                        eeriness of this place. The lush green climbers and creepers along the falls and the vast area
                        surrounding trickling waters are ideal for a swim. The cold waters tickle the ribs making for a
                        fun time with nature.

                        Dunhinda Falls is at Badulla, approximately an hour away from Ella. The falls tumble down a
                        narrow gap between rocks and expand to form a stunning smoky cascade—an appearance reminiscent
                        of a bridal veil; no wonder it is also known as Bridal Falls. The falls finally crash into a
                        pool at the bottom.

                        Dunhinda Falls flows down from an altitude of 63 metres, and a stream named Badulu Oya forms the
                        waterfall. After a hike of more than a kilometre from the entrance gate, comprising muddy
                        trails, a suspension bridge and steep steps, the sight of this picturesque waterfall welcomes
                        visitors. Along the way, the Small Dunhinda falls, and diverse fauna such as butterflies,
                        monkeys and birds can be spotted.

                        Thudugala Ella waterfall is situated in the Thudugala village of Kalutara district. This western
                        province is located 40 km away from Colombo at complete connectivity with the other coastal
                        beaches. Unlike many waterfalls that are perched on a hilltop at massive heights, Thudugala
                        stands apart. The waters flow on rocks that gradient at intermittent levels. The irregularity
                        causes the waters to gush, making a soft thud. The waters are cold and they make a euphony as
                        they hit the pools of water.

                        The calm flow of waters is an excellent bathing spot to soak yourself in the natural ponds -
                        perfect for a swim date with friends and family! Thudugala has an altitude that is entirely
                        scalable in comparison to many others. Hence just climbing up atop wet rocks makes for a fun,
                        adventurous activity. Tall trees and the impeccable golden sun glaze the pools.There also exists
                        a tunnel that hides underwater and pours out on an opening along the top. The structure is
                        sophisticated yet elegant. History has it that a Britisher owned the estates around the falls in
                        the days of war and one can still spot his ruined house in the neighbourhood. At 26 metres
                        height, Thudugala falls, though one of the smallest, is listed among the most famous waterfalls
                        in the country by Lanka Council on Water Falls (CLWF).

                        Mahamevnama Monastery is part of the series of monasteries which originated from Sri Lanka but
                        grew to nine other countries including Canada, United States of America and Australia. The
                        primary purpose is to present the spiritual teachings of Gautama Buddha easily so that people
                        can easily understand it.

                        The most famous and the primary Mahamevnama Monastery is located at Polgahawela. Here, you can
                        also visit the sacred Bodhi tree complex and the Dhammachakkha stupa, make some offerings to the
                        shrine, browse through the collection of teaching in an informative book shop or become a part
                        of the evening chant. The monks at this monastery also speak in English so you can have a chat
                        with them about Buddhism or meditation. Further, there is also the option of going for a guided
                        tour or a self-guided tour of the monastery, which is also available in English.

                        The Mahamevnama Monastery was founded in Sri Lanka in 1999 by Ven. Kiribathgoda Gnanananda
                        Thero. The monastery is a warm and welcoming place for anyone who wishes to learn the teachings
                        of Buddha in the form of Dhamma and gain peace through meditation. The monastery today is home
                        to over 800 monks and 75 nuns who practise and preach the principles of Buddhism.

                        Udawalawe National Park gets its name from Udawalawe reservoir that was built on Walawe river.
                        Animals that were displaced due to the development were shifted to the national park. It is one
                        of
                        the oldest national parks in Sri Lanka that was established in the year 1972.

                        The area where this national park is built over was earlier used by farmers for shifting
                        cultivation
                        but then they were removed from this area. This national park in Sri Lanka is especially known
                        for
                        being home to water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. You'll find herds of more than 50 Sri Lankan
                        elephants here and there are close to 600 of them in the park.

                        Located at an elevation of 2,300 metres, Horton Plains National Park in Sri Lanka’s central
                        highlands encompasses montane grassland and cloudy forests. It is a government protected area
                        which
                        is home to many endemic flora and fauna species, with spectacular jungles and mountains on one
                        side
                        and a plateau on the other. The park is a popular for housing the famed ‘World’s End Cliff’, a
                        long,
                        steep plunge of 880m where the plateau comes to a dramatic stop.

                        The most popular thing to do in Horton Plains National Park is hiking to the World’s End cliff.
                        Surrounded by tea gardens, World’s End overlooks numerous lakes, waterfalls, rocky hills, and
                        the
                        scintillating ocean. During the hike, a popular stop is the multi-tiered, 20-metre-tall Baker’s
                        Waterfall, where you can swim during monsoon.

                        Since being converted into a national park around 1988, Horton Plains National Park has been
                        luring
                        a significant number of people. The national park is home to a variety of wildlife species, most
                        notably purple-faced langurs, Sri Lankan leopards, Red Slender Loris, Toque monkeys, magpies and
                        sambar deer. There are also many species of woody plants in this region.

                        Not to be missed out on is the Farr Inn, a British-colonial style hunting lodge now converted
                        into a
                        trekkers’ meeting point. The lodge houses a coffee shop, souvenir shop and museum showcasing the
                        national park’s rich history.
